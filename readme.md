# 👻 Haunted House – Dynamic Lighting & Shaders

🌐 **Live Demo**: [hauntedscene.vercel.app](https://hauntedscene.vercel.app/)

This is a spooky, atmospheric real-time 3D scene built using **Three.js**. Featuring a haunted house, dynamic lighting, eerie volumetric fog, and real-time shader effects, this project showcases advanced 3D graphics and creative coding — all in the browser.

## ✨ Features

- **🏚️ Haunted House Scene**  
  A detailed haunted house model, crooked gravestones, and a hanging man set a chilling tone. Every asset is hand-placed for maximum creepiness.

- **💡 Dynamic Lighting**  
  Adjustable ambient, directional (moonlight), and point lights that cast shadows and change the mood dramatically.

- **🌫️ Volumetric Fog**  
  Shader-based fog system lets you control density and color for more depth and mystery.

- **🎛 Real-Time GUI Control**  
  Includes a lil-gui panel for adjusting scene properties (light, fog, etc.) in real time — no code required.

- **⚡ Optimized for Performance**  
  Built with performance in mind using efficient assets and shader code to run smoothly even with complex effects.
